# Word Search Program
Word Search is a project for Data Structure course | TCSS 342 | @the University of Washington Tacoma
<br/>
Word Search Program used my own LinkedList, Binary Search Tree, and AVL Tree Data Structure.

## Description
This program compares the performance of storing the words from Leo Tolstoyâ€™s War and 
Peace literature in LinkedList with storing them in a binary search tree. The strategy uses the two common search and addition functions of three data structures: 
a linked list, a binary search tree, and an AVL self-balancing binary search tree.

## Getting Started
- Build the binary search tree data structure.
- Build the self-balancing binary search tree datastructure.
- Use a linked list and a binary search tree to storeover 20000 pieces of data.
- Benchmark linked list and binary search tree performance.
